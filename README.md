# Vietnamese Information Authentication Problem

## Project Overview
This project aims to address the **information authentication** challenges in Vietnam, particularly focusing on **fake news detection** and verifying the credibility of news sources. With the rapid spread of information through social media and digital platforms, ensuring the reliability and authenticity of online content has become a pressing issue. 

The project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and state-of-the-art models such as **PhOBERT** (a pre-trained transformer model for Vietnamese text) to build a robust system for identifying **misinformation**.

## Objectives
- Build a machine learning model capable of detecting **fake news** and assessing the reliability of news sources.
- Utilize **PhOBERT** and other deep learning models for **Vietnamese language processing**.
- Develop an interactive tool to assist in real-time news verification.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
  - **HuggingFace Transformers**: Pre-trained models such as PhOBERT.
  - **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Frameworks for deep learning.
  - **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Environment**:
  - Python 3.x
  - Jupyter Notebook for interactive development
